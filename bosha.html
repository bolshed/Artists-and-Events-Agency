    <h1>Bosha</h1>
    <img src="bosha.jpg" style="width: 25%">
    <p>Born and bred in Sofia, Bulgaria, currently based in Berlin, Bosha's mature sense of club sound in the realm of house and techno will surely not pass unnoticed and allure anyone who has the ear for quality selection and technique.

    His club life starts late 90s when he discovers his passion for electronic music. It is then that Bosha starts playing at small events mostly organized with friends. Later on, being already a usual suspect behind the decks in some cult Sofia clubs, he joins the back then newly found local agency - Tochka booking, which ultimately leaves a lasting mark on the Bulgarian house music scene.

    In following years Bosha shapes a style, influenced on one side by Tresor & Detroit, on the other by deep, UK & West coast house. He lines up at many festivals, club parties and endless afterhours sessions in Bulgaria and abroad. His devotion to the music throughout the years has transformed into sophistication and mastery behind the decks.</p>
