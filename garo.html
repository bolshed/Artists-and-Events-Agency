    <h1>Garo</h1>
    <img src="garo.jpg" style="width: 25%">
    <p>Garo is one of the key architects behind the blossoming underground scene in Sofia. Curator of the Studio EW, he has been instrumental in bringing the likes of Nicolas Lutz, Jane Fitz, Vera, Binh, Francesco del Garda, Maayan Nidam, and many more leading contemporaries to his native Bulgaria for the first time.

    Having outgrown the scene he helped to create, in 2013 Garo moved to Berlin lured by the endless possibilities the city could offer for his own personal and musical development. A bona-fide crate digger, he is often to be found head buried in the bins of Berlin´s record stores and vinyl markets, searching for rare pearls. Such dedication and diligence towards unearthing dusty treasures allied to his own rich cultural heritage have endowed him with that much sought after ability to effortlessly blend old school and contemporary alike, encompassing a wide range of genres- “every track has its moment” he says, “what matters most is the groove”.

    Always bearing a wide grin from ear to ear, Garo´s infectiously positive and charming persona allied to his distinguished ability for selecting fine, cerebral records has since seen him quietly and unassumingly gain the plaudits of more established peers in the scene.</p>
